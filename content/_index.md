# Hi, I'm Rafael 👋

## About Me

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate. I studied in Spain, where I graduated second in my class. I also spent 8 months studying abroad in Finland, where I presented [my final thesis](https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/858181).

My passion for computers started when I was a child, playing Valve and Nintendo games. Back when I was in school, there was a cybercafé nearby. I would spend entire afternoons playing *Counter-Strike* and *Half-Life* there. At home, a relative had a Wii, and that's where I fell in love with Nintendo games (particularly *Super Mario Galaxy* and *Super Mario 64*).

As time went by, I developed a great interest in how computers work at a low level and how things like operating systems work under the hood. This has prompted me to be very curious and explore beyond "black boxes" (I still have a ton to learn!).

Currently, I'm focused on working on my own little projects using languages like C, Rust 🦀, and Python 🐍, although I can adapt to other languages easily thanks to my degree.

I've also been daily-driving Linux and other open-source software for some years now. I haven't looked back even once!
