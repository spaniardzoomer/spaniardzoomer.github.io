You can find all the configuration files for this programs on my [dotfiles repo](https://gitlab.com/rinuxu/dotfiles).

## 🖥️ Operating System & Desktop Environment

  * **[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)**: I love this distribution because of its DIY approach, and I've been using it for several years now. In Arch Linux, you get dropped into a shell, and you have to do the installation all by yourself. Also, nothing comes installed by default. This is my favourite part, as I love knowing everything that is installed on my system. Thanks to that, it is lightweight and flexible.
  * **[suckless dwm (Dynamic Window Manager)](https://dwm.suckless.org/)**: A minimalist, tiling window manager for X. Very simple and lightweight. Customization can be cumbersome, as it requires you to edit the source code and compile it every time, but that is part of its beauty too.
  * **[rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)**: A window switcher, application launcher, and dmenu replacement. It is highly customizable and flexible. It can work as an app launcher, calculator, menu... whatever you want, really.
  * **[GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)**: Symlink farm manager. I use this to manage my dotfiles.

## ⌨️ Terminal & Shell

  * **[kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)**: A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. I used Alacritty for the longest time, but kitty has built-in support for rendering images, and that's why I'm using it for now.
  * **[Zsh (Z Shell)](https://www.zsh.org/)**: An extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh) with many improvements, including better auto-completion, shared history, and theme support.
  * **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)**: A general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. Super flexible and shines when combining it with scripts.

## 📂 File Management

  * **[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)**: A terminal file manager written in Go. Customizable, and it looks really cool, especially with image previews.
  * **[Thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start)**: A modern, lightweight graphical file manager.

## 🌐 Web & Internet

  * **[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)**: A fork of Firefox that focuses on privacy, security, and freedom. It comes with telemetry disabled and tracking protection enabled by default. I'm using this while I wait for Ladybird.

## 📝 Development & Text Editing

  * **[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)**: A text editor based on Vim. I specifically use a distribution called [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) since it makes some things easier, but it is still minimal out of the box.
  * **[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)**: A distribution of VS Code without the built-in telemetry/tracking. I use this when I need a more complete IDE experience than Neovim, but I try to use Neovim as much as possible to avoid getting rusty.

## 🎬 Multimedia & Content Creation

  * **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)**: The ultimate command-line tool for media. I use it mainly to record my screen.
  * **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)**: A command-line program to download videos from YouTube and other video sites.
  * **[Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/)**: I have always used DaVinci Resolve, but it looks like it is broken on Arch Linux at the moment.
  * **[ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli)**: A command-line interface tool that allows you to browse and watch anime directly from the terminal.
  * **[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)**: A powerful and easy-to-use e-book manager. It handles library management, format conversion (e.g., EPUB to MOBI), and syncing to e-readers.
  * **[KCC (Kindle Comic Converter)](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc)**: A tool to convert comic and manga files (CBZ, CBR, PDF) into formats optimized for e-readers like Kindle and Kobo. If you haven't read comics or manga on an e-ink device, you are really missing out. Do yourself a favor and get a second-hand e-reader\!

### 📡 Networking & Sync

  * **[LocalSend](https://github.com/localsend/localsend)**: An open-source, cross-platform alternative to AirDrop. It allows you to securely share files and text between devices on your local network without an internet connection.
  * **[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)**: An open-source file synchronization program that syncs files between two or more computers.
  * **[Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole)**: I use it on a Raspberry Pi connected to my router, and every device in my house uses it as a DNS server to block ads and malicious sites.
