These are all my personal opinion of course. These games are here because they had a big impact on my childhood/teen years.

## [Call of Duty: Black Ops 2](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_II)

For me, the peak of the series was every COD from *Call of Duty 4* to *Black Ops 2*. These games were extremely fun and had good campaigns with characters you actually cared about, fun progression systems, and Zombies. My introduction to the franchise was *Black Ops 2*, but I liked it so much that I went out of my way to buy and try the previous ones, and they were all awesome.

After *Black Ops 2*, I think the series went downhill. I do think that *Advanced Warfare*, *Infinite Warfare*, *Black Ops 3*, *Ghosts*, and *WWII* had some things going for them and were still fun, but from *Black Ops 4* onwards, I couldn't be bothered.

It is a shame that these games were all abandoned quickly. They are still sold at full price on Steam, yet Activision doesn't even care to fix the rampant hackers and [remote code execution exploits](https://steamcommunity.com/app/202970/discussions/0/6741412150954273795/) in these old titles.

## [Battlefield 3](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_3) & [4](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_4)

These games were peak FPS. Huge maps, unmatched graphics (even to this day), and combined vehicle and infantry warfare—I don't think anything has come close to *Battlefield 3* and *4*. The campaigns were also decent.

I remember playing *Battlefield 3* for the first time; coming from COD, I was completely blown away by the graphics, the sound design, and the size of the maps. It really had everything. These games were extremely fun, especially on meat-grinder maps like Metro, or iconic maps like Damavand Peak or Caspian Border. The DLCs were also awesome, especially the *Close Quarters* one from Battlefield 3. Plus, the soldiers' voice lines were iconic.

I know a lot of people didn't like *Battlefield 4*, but I think it was an appropriate follow-up to *Battlefield 3*. It improved a lot of things, added China as a new faction, had tons—and I mean *tons*—of content at launch (even if it was really buggy and rough), and let's not even talk about "Levolution." That skyscraper falling down in *Siege of Shanghai* will always remain one of the most impressive things I've ever seen in a game. I even pre-ordered this game on the PS3... imagine that.

## [Battlefield 1](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_1)

*Battlefield 1* was a divisive game in the community. I mean, WWI? Really? Still, the game was loads of fun. In my opinion, the gameplay was a bit rough and too casual, but one thing this game excels at is immersion. You don't believe me? Look up videos with the HUD disabled. That thing is a movie masked as a video game. Also, even in 2025, the graphics of this game are unmatched... and it runs well too!

Sniping was super fun, the campaign was beautiful, and the soundtrack was top-notch. Besides the gameplay, what is there not to love about this game? It will always have a special place in my heart.

Do I need to say anything? This game was a crucial part of my childhood, and I still play it to this day. Truly a timeless piece of art.

## [Tom Clancy's The Division](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_The_Division)

It is a shame how nobody seems to remember this game. I think it was an awesome extraction shooter. Yes, it had a lot of problems (as expected with Ubisoft), a massive downgrade compared to the trailers, almost no story, and bullet-sponge enemies. However, it was really fun, and the atmosphere of that snowy New York was incredible. I would actually walk instead of run between objectives just to enjoy the atmosphere.

## [Watch Dogs](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Dogs)

Again from Ubisoft, this game suffered a massive downgrade compared to the E3 showcases. However, I think the story was interesting, Aiden was a pretty badass protagonist, and being a computer scientist myself, all the "hacker" stuff was appealing. I think Ubisoft could've done a lot more with this game, but I still remember it fondly.
